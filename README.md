# 👋 Hi, I'm Feng

```text
AI-assisted Systems Engineer
```

I build **reliable, deterministic systems** for the real world.
AI is a tool — engineering is the foundation.

---

## 🧠 What I Do

* 🔧 **Embedded & Industrial Systems**
* 🤖 **AI-assisted Engineering**
* 🧪 **Test Infrastructure & HIL Systems**
* ⚙️ **Automation, Diagnostics, Long-running Systems**

I focus on systems that **run for years**, not demos that run once.

## 🧭 Engineering Philosophy

```text
Engineering first.
Determinism matters.
AI assists, systems decide.
```

* Prefer **explicit control** over hidden magic
* Trust **specs, logs, and measurements**
* Build things that others can **maintain and extend**
